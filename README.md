# who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-in-C-
C++ program to simulate the international TV game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”

The questions are simple math questions. To start the game, enter an integer for the program to generate random value for the math questions.
You will reach a checkpoint when you answer the 5th and 10th question correctly.

During the game, you can choose the "Jump" option to skip one question, but if you try to skip the checkpoint questions and anwser the next question wrongly, then the safety net will not apply, and thus the player will earn $0 (or $5000 if they skip the 10th question and then answer incorrectly). You can't use the "Jump" option to skip the last question (the "Jump" option will disappear in the last question even if you haven't used it previously).

Moreover, you can choose the "Withdraw" option at any question to earn the money you've already won.
